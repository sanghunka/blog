 Have you ever heard about [Smart rope](http://smartrope.tangramfactory.com/en/)? By using persistence of vision, This jump rope shows how many times you jumped on air. Smart rope was successfully raised seed money at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1990698791/smart-rope/description) last year.

Jump rope is convenient. It doesn't need expensive fitness equipment and large space. You can work out without partner. It needs only rope and a little space. But jump counting is bothersome. You can count it easily at first. As time goes by, you are out of breath and exhausted so the counting becomes more difficult.

> 2997, 2998, 2999, 3000, 3100, 3100, ???
  
When counting makes me confused, I feel irritated. Then I don't wanna do jumping any more. Some people may say 'Is counting important?'. For me, It is my daily goal and gives me sense of accomplishment.

I bought this jump rope almost 20 times expensive than normal one. At first, The idea writing numbers by using persistence of vision attracts my attention. It looks like from future world. By **smart rope**, I would be set free from counting. Not only this function, It's design looks cool. In fact, the name of manufacturer is Tangram **Design Lab**!

<a name='pros'></a>

### Pros
- Forget countings.
- Focus on working out itself.
- When using at night, people shows special interests.
- Armband free

> you don't have to attach smartphone to body for measuring jump. It will be recoded automatically by Smart Gym via bluetooth.

<a name='cons'></a>

### Cons
- Price
- Hard to set LED position.
- Breakdown concern

> You can set the position of LED number by controlling left grip(eye-level or ground-level). But it is not delicate. Also Led embedded part hits ground on every jump. There is a concern for breakdown. Above all things, price is the biggest barrier to buy.
