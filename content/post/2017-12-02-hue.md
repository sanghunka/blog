## Step 1: Clone the Hue repository

```bash
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git
```

## Step 2: Install Java
-   최신 JDK [다운로드](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
-   `java -version`으로 설치된 버전 확인.


## Step 3: Install the pre-requisites
Hue uses several libraries that are not included in the XCode command line tools so we will need to install that too. To do that we will use Homebrew, the fantastic open source package manager for Mac OS X. Install it from Terminal with

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew doctor
brew update
brew install maven
brew install mysql
brew install gmp
```


## Step 3b (just for El Capitan and Sierra): export ENV variables for openssl
-   If you have OS X El Capitan or macOS Sierra, you need an extra mini step to be able to make Hue:

```bash
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib && export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```


## Step 4: Compile and configure Hue

-   from the Hue folder that was created by the git clone in step 1
-   `make apps`


## Step 5: Configure your /etc/hosts
-   The last thing we should do is to start the Quickstart VM and get its IP address

```bash
sudo vi /etc/hosts
{your-ip} quickstart.cloudera
```


## Step 6: Run!
-   `./build/env/bin/hue runserver`
-   <http://localhost:8000>! Go and write a new app now! 🙂
